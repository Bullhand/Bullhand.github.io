        <li>the scuience to getting in shape and look good isnt hard but the diffrence for wrether you want to be big like a body builder or a funcatinal person.</li>
        <li>if you want to be big you would want to do each exersice 3 to 4 sets and 8 to 12 reps each time to tear the mucls the right way and do compound workouts for each boyd part.</li>
        <li>if you want to be more functional then i would sugest doing full body exersizes which include power cleans jerks must be included if your workot 4 times a week. do each exersize 5 sets of 4 to 15 rebs depending on weight.</li>
        <li> lastley if you wish to be more of both do an hybrid of both 4 to 5 sets of 6 to 13 rebs for each exersie so you can train your stamina and get streagh to pack muscel on you all at the same tiem.</li>
