            <li>rodeo has been around for houndred of years it first came around when ranches wanted to see who had the toughest cowboys.</li>
            <li>rodeo has now become a world renown sport its something once it gets in your blood you cant get it out. the one sport that is able to get everyone off there feet is bullridng.</li>
            <li>bullriding is the most dangerous sport out of all of the but at the same time its the most exciting that the make the PBR which is just bullriding. </li>
            <li>my favriote moive about bullriding is 8 seconds who is about lane frost. and thats who i want to be a world champion bullrider but theres a problem. rodeo is dying.</li>
            <li>rodeo has taught me so much about life and that you can die at any moment ive seen people die there first time riding a 14 year olf from NC passsed two weeks ago doing what he loved</li>
            <li>here are some videos about rodeo and its history</li>
